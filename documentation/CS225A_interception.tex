\section*{Projectile Interception}
The area that the robot defends is inside a hemisphere centered on the robot base.
 The surface of this volume is where the robot intercepts incoming projectiles. Once the trajectory of the projectile has been estimated,
  If the projectile will intersect the dome, the robot moves to reach the intersection
   point. The intersection point is found by solving the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x &= x_0+v_x*t+\frac{1}{2}a_x^2\\
y &= y_0+v_y*t+\frac{1}{2}a_y^2\\
z &= z_0+v_z*t+\frac{1}{2}a_z^2\\
R^2 &= x^2+y^2+z^2
\end{align*}

The acceleration in z is assumed to be $-9.81 \frac{m}{s}$ while in x and y it
 is assumed to be zero. The radius $R$ of the sphere is chosen to be within the reachable workspace of the robot. We used a polynomial solver 
 on the fourth order equation in $t$ to find the time and location
  that the predicted trajectory would intercept the sphere.
